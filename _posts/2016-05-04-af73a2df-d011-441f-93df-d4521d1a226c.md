![Found in the entrance of my house.](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/2d173f83-2c41-4821-a9fd-74f54d78f730.jpg)

My first theory was that kids buy packs of instant ramen and eat it on their way home. This bag was found in the entrance of my house, between the inner and outer doors. Either the wind carried it in, or a neighbor. I think we don't have kids in the house that walk home alone. 

Also, what flavor is this? It could be meat or shrimp.
